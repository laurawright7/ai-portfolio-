## Portfolio Projects (In Progress)

These projects are designed to demonstrate real-world problem solving, clarity of documentation, and the ability to work across both technical and operational needs.

### Legal Intake Copilot Agent  
A conversational agent built with Microsoft Copilot Studio that guides users through an intake process and stores responses in a SharePoint list. Includes branching logic and data validation.

A Copilot Studio agent that asks structured qualification questions, assigns a lead score, and records results for follow-up by a sales team.

### Python Sentiment Analyzer (Client Feedback Demo)  
A simple Python script that classifies sentiment of survey responses or written feedback, demonstrating fundamental programming and NLP model usage.
